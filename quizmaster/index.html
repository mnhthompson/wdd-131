     <h1>Welcome to the Quiz App</h1>
     <p>Tests are beneficial for kids because they provide a structured way to assess their understanding and help identify areas where they may need more support. They encourage kids to focus on their learning, reinforce knowledge, and develop problem-solving skills. Tests also teach valuable life skills, such as time management, perseverance, and handling stress in a controlled environment. By preparing for tests, kids learn how to organize their thoughts and study effectively, which are essential skills both in and outside the classroom. Additionally, regular assessments can motivate kids to stay engaged in their education and strive for continuous improvement.</p>
